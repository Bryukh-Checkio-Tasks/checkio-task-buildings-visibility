<p>
    The robots have requested your help in setting up a new base on the island.
    They need you to define the visibility of a buildings from a specific direction,
    in this case, south. To help you out, you have been given a map of the buildings in the complex.
    The map is an orthogonal projection of each of the buildings onto a horizontal plane.
    It is oriented on a rectangular coordinate system so that the positive x-axis points east and
    the positive y-axis points north. No two buildings in the map overlap or touch.
    Each of the buildings have perfectly rectangular sides and are aligned from north to south and from east to west.
    The map is the list of buildings. The building is presented as the list with coordinate of south-west corner,
    coordinate of north-east corner and height - [Xsw, Ysw, Xne, Yne, height].
    We need to determinate how many of the buildings are visible from the area just south of the base (excluding the angle of vision,
    just using projection.) See the illustration below.

    <strong>Input:</strong>A list of lists with buildings coordinates and heights.
    The coordinates and the heights are integers or floats.
