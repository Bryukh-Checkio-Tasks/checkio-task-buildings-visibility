    The robots have requested your help setting up a new base on the island.
    They need you to define the visibility of a building from the southern edge of the base.
    To help you out, you have been given a map of the buildings in the complex.
    The map is an orthogonal projection of each of the buildings onto a horizontal plane.
    It is oriented on a rectangular coordinate system so that the positive x-axis points east and
    the positive y-axis points north. No two buildings in the map overlap or touch.
    Each of the buildings have perfectly rectangular sides and are aligned from north to south and from east to west.
    The map is a list of buildings. Every building is presented as the list with coordinate of south-west corner,
    coordinate of north-east corner and height - [Xsw, Ysw, Xne, Yne, height].
    We need to determinate how many of the buildings are visible from the area just south of the base (excluding the angle of vision,
    just using projection.) See the illustration below.

<p>
    <strong>Input:</strong> Building coordinates and heights as a list of lists.
    The coordinates are integers. The heights are integers or floats.
</p>

<p><strong>Output:</strong>The quantity of visible buildings as an integer. </p>

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    This concept is useful for image recognition systems and graphical systems.
    When rendering of 3D model you should determine the visibility of the surfaces.
    This concept also can be applied in architecture and city planning,
    allowing you to plan out which sides of a building will receive sunlight,
    or if a building will block natural light in another building.
